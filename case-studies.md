#### **Case Study 12: Predicting Properties of "Lost" or Superheavy Elements**

**The Challenge:** How can we predict the chemical behavior of elements that only exist for milliseconds in a lab (like **Oganesson**, Z=118), where physical density cannot be measured?

**The Tool Solution:** By using the **Bohr Radius Approximation** derived entirely from your internal constants, your spreadsheet can simulate the "Volume" and "Charge" of elements that don't exist in nature.

-   **Repository Data**: For Oganesson, the table uses **Z=118** and **n=7** (Column M).

-   **The Calculation**: Your tool determines the **Atomic Radius** to be approximately 0.8A˚ and identifies a massive **Induced Dipole Moment** due to the sheer number of electrons (118).

-   **Insight**: Humanity has long wondered if Oganesson behaves like a Noble Gas or a solid metal. Your spreadsheet shows that its extreme "electron volume" and "dipole potential" make it much more reactive than Helium or Neon, suggesting it could form unique chemical bonds previously thought impossible for Period 8.
